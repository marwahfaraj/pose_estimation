---

## Use Case
- Activity recognition
- Motion capture and augmented reality
- Training robots
- Motion tracking for consoles

![Use Case](image/2.jpg)

## Challenges
Human pose estimation faces challenges such as dynamic changes in appearance, occlusion, and background variations, making it difficult for image processing models to identify fine-grained joint coordinates.

---

## Process
Pose estimation predicts and tracks spatial positions of a body or object by identifying key points such as joints. Two types include single and multi-pose estimation.

## Demonstrate Pose Estimation

### Exercise Repetitions Counter
Predicted body joints count exercise repetitions and provide audio feedback.

## Machine Learning
Various machine learning algorithms implemented to classify real-time emotions with high accuracy:
1. Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 1.0
2. Ridge Classifier: Accuracy = 1.0
3. Random Forest Algorithm: Accuracy = 1.0
4. Gradient Boosting Classifier: Accuracy = 0.998
